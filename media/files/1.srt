1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,965
Previously on "Power"...

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,929
When we met,
what'd you think I was gonna be?

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,128
The biggest goddamn drug
dealer in New York City.

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,250
I don't know any old,
wrinkled drug dealers.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,890
They're either dead or inside.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,448
Since when do you lie to me?
Since when do you hide shit?

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,011
Ghost took back his loyalty,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,924
so now it's time
for you to do the same.

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,844
I want to change my life for you.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,082
I don't want
to break up your marriage.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,730
You like having me around, huh?

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,609
- I do.
- I want your offer.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,485
- $6 million to own it outright.
- Truth is not for sale.

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,524
The moment I detect disloyalty,
I cut it out.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,681
You was right about Rolla.

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,207
- I'm sorry it turned out like this, G.
- It was Kanan, right?

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,010
You were still tight
after all these years.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,288
I am your friend.

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,811
Rolla's dead.
You owe me money.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,325
And you owe me bodies.

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,005
You make sure my son
ain't there when you do it, neither.

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,322
I want Ghost dead
before I get out.

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,244
I'm your friend.

24
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,771
I guess we should get to it.

25
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,809
I am your friend.

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,280
They say we supposed
to get 10 inches.

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,400
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,764
I'm your friend.

29
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,089
Glass was empty.

30
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,289
The coroner found whiskey
in Rolla's stomach.

31
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,091
So whoever killed him
gave him a last drink.

32
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,921
That's classy.

33
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,850
So I hear you turned down
the new border task force in Detroit.

34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,125
- Guess you'll be sticking around?
- Rolla's murder is a new lead.

35
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,041
Sure, but we have
no money to follow it.

36
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,810
With Lobos
being prosecuted in California,

37
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,246
they've shut us down.

38
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,847
Now Rolla's death
is officially an NYPD case,

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,365
just like Anibal.

40
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,931
Might be the same hitter.

41
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,691
I don't think so.
He had a drink.

42
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,684
At the kill shot, he fell right out
of his chair onto the floor.

43
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,201
No defensive wounds,
no sign of struggle.

44
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,046
- You think it was someone he knew.
- And he didn't see it coming.

45
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,441
He trusted the person.

46
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,170
You think it was the distributor?

47
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,606
You think it was Ghost?

48
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,882
You could be right.

49
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,407
But it doesn't matter.

50
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,040
Cali will have Lobos indicted
by the end of the week.
